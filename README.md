# Animation
 A small website animation I made using HTML and CSS. It's a bouncing ball ‚öΩüëç

### bugs:
- changing resolution will possibly break everything
- there's < span> at the beginning that can be replaced but not deleted
- clouds are messy
## todo:
- add more objects
- animate things
- fix bugs
- add support for older browsers
